# Brandon-OS
Super simple boot loader with extra features and some commands
I used public resources and code segments from various places like stack overflow but coded a lot by myself

## Commands
* Hello
* Echo
* Reboot (Not really just clears screen and reloads to the beginning)
* Shutdown (Also not really)

## Compiling
I used Nasm to compile this into its proper binary
> nasm brandon-os.txt -f bin -o brandon-os.bin
